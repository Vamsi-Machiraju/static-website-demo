                    <h3>Vamsi Machiraju</h3>
                    <p><strong>Founder & CEO</strong></p>
                      <p class="team-left-align-text">
                            With nearly 25 years of diverse experience, Vamsi Machiraju brings together the precision of a software engineer, 
                            the heart of a social changemaker, and the vision of a compassionate entrepreneur.<br><br>

                            In the <strong>first phase </strong>of his career, he worked in India and the United States with top global technology firms, 
                            gaining deep technical and product development expertise. Despite a successful career in IT, he made a bold shift into the 
                            <strong>second phase</strong> of his life — dedicating over a decade to <strong></strong>non-profit service, 
                            focusing on <strong>women empowerment, skill development, and community awareness</strong>. During this time, 
                            he also founded a <strong>social enterprise </strong> to market eco-friendly products like jute bags and garments 
                            crafted by women artisans, and later launched a digital channel to amplify community voices on pressing social issues. 
                            These efforts were largely sustained through personal savings and the generous support of like-minded 
                            individuals who believed in the mission.<br><br>

                            Now entering the <strong>third phase</strong>, Vamsi Machiraju has returned to technology with a 
                            renewed mission — building CodePaws Technologies, a company that leverages modern tech and AI to create meaningful impact. 
                            The company’s flagship platform, <strong>UpEduSkills</strong>, is a reflection of his belief in accessible, 
                            skill-based education that empowers both learners and educators.<br><br>

                            The name <strong>CodePaws</strong> was inspired not only by our love for animals, but by the love and companionship 
                            we received from them, along with a vision to eventually support 
                            animal welfare causes — a dream shared with his wife and co-director, 
                            who has been a quiet yet constant force throughout this journey.

                        Lavanya Machiraju is the heart behind <strong>CodePaws</strong> — not through lines of code, but through her lifelong compassion and quiet service to animals. 
                        As the life partner of founder <strong>Vamsi Machiraju</strong>, her wish for a better life for all animals, along with the love and companionship 
                        received from animals, shaped the company’s name and the purpose they hope to fulfill as they grow.<br><br>
                        
                        While not directly involved in the technical or operational side, Lavanya has played a steady and enduring role in shaping the 
                        journey of CodePaws Technologies. As a <strong>founding director</strong> and life partner, her quiet strength and unwavering belief 
                        in the vision of <strong>UpEduSkills</strong> made it possible for the platform to be built from the ground up<br><br>

                        Through every chapter of her husband’s life — From his early years working with top technology firms 
                        in India and the United States, through a decade in the non-profit sector, to launching 
                        a <strong>mission-driven tech company </strong>— Lavanya stood by with strength, grace, and a willingness to 
                        lead a simple life in service of a greater purpose. Her values continue to guide the
